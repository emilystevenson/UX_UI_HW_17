<h1 style="text-align:center; color: darkgoldenrod;">Hi</h1>
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="Beautiful Picture of Me" width="104" height="142">
<p>I create effective UX/UI solutions through meaningful 
    <br>user connections, intuitive problem solving, and good 
    <br>taste. Using my chronic perfectionism, I aim to meet 
    <br>clients’ goals by using a proven process and executing 
    <br>insightful, clean, and effective designs. I have experience 
    <br>working on extensive marketing campaigns, where I 
    <br>gained strong organization, communication, and 
    <br>research skills. I strive to make my clients’ lives easier 
    <br>using my creativity, analytical thinking, and enthusiasm 
    <br> for new projects.
